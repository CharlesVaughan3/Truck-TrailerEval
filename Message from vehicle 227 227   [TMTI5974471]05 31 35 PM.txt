Defect Found?: Yes
Tractor Defect?: Yes
Tractor Defect Details?: Other
Remarks: I know the exhaust brake is intermittent but it always will engage when you tap or press the 
brake pedal but lately it is not engaging every time when I press the pedal and it happens when going 
downhill on winding roads which is a safety hazard. Please check into this for me.
