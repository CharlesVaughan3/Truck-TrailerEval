# Truck-TrailerEval
Summary of trucks and trailers that currently have problems and/or are in the shop.

This worksheet derives from another sheet known as Final_Project_DVIR_rollout_3.xlsm 
that is upkept by our shop. When they complete a DVIR in the shop it gets moved from the DVIR folder to the completed folder and this sheet can no longer see the issues. This program can also be found on https://github.com/CharlesVaughan3 

The purpose of this program is for our disbatchers to have easy access to seeing which trucks/trailers they can not assign to drivers. 
It also saves time of the shop having to communicate with the disbatcher and gives them an easier time when a driver might ask them questions. 

This program is useful for reading files and printing out specific lines that you want read. It also has functionality that removes the word that you search for in the text file so it will display only the part of the line you are looking for. 

Any questions or concerns contact Charles @ cvaughan@stewarttransport.com
